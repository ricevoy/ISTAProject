# ISTA PROJECT STEP ONE
## Rawlston Morton
### July 5th, 2020

- It is common for people to be hesitant to admit the amount of time they realistically spend online. The world has gone digital, leaving most to reference the web for their information. In this sense, we have become experts in data consumption and utilization. The general population can usually tell when a website or application is poorly built or unoptimized. I cannot count the amount of times where I have said, “Even I can build something better than this.” Funny enough, I am now fortunate enough to be in a situation to put my money where my mouth is. My name is Rawlston Morton, I am 22-year old Marine Veteran seeking a job of any form in Information Technology. I have known from a very young age that I eventually wanted to work with computers and now is my chance. Thanks to the MSSA program, I will be able to apply myself and learn as most as I can while also becoming a true professional in pursuit of a career. Everybody has started somewhere. In IT, problems have all been solved at least once, one way or another. In order to brainstorm for my final project, I have scoured the internet for ideas to eventually create something all on my own. 
-	High School Website	
-For my first reviewed project I decided to get back to my roots and check out my old high school’s website. While attending that school, I remember the website being starved of useful information. They have since began emulating the school districts website, making it appear much more vibrant and on par with some college portals like ERAU. Out of curiosity, I looked through every tab on the website to try and find mistakes or take points that I will use for my own project. After coming across the “Thespians” directory, I found information that has not been updated since 2014. I also found plenty of directories that were present, but completely absent of information. On the other hand, I can tell you every English teacher’s name and phone number because the “English Department” is absolutely flooded with vital information. I can assume that the data is input by either the staff or an administrator. Since the information does not have to be put in by one person, it creates an efficient way to keep the website updated and this is how I want my Project to be set up. Relevant information can easily be found thanks to those staff that keep their contact cards and tutoring schedules up to date.
-	Sports Statistics
- For my second reviewed project I analyzed the website “Max Preps.” This website is a collection of sports statistics kept for High School students that are prospects for some of the best colleges in the country. There is a student at my brother’s school who is being scouted for a Division 1 College to play basketball. When searching said students name, you are immediately greeted with all the statistics for every sport he has played in High School. On his personal page the website has created for him, you can find his contact information, this makes it easy for college recruiters to send offers and allegiances to their schools. For my project, I would like to implement the ability to easily identify vital information. The website uses public information to keep students’ personally identifiable information private. The information regarding his statistics is most likely input from a database where top tier student-athletes are tracked. 
-	Online Shopping Website
- For my third reviewed project I dove deeper into “AliExpress,” I like to refer to this website as international Amazon. AliExpress is a shopping outlet for anything and everything at extreme discounts due to buying products at the source (China.) I like to personally use AliExpress because of the awesome coupons that are offered to you right as you open the site. This website is chocked full of amazing deals that are catered to your personal interests. After about a week, the shopping is practically done for you due to its ability to recognize your wants and needs. Luckily, I can see past the “hot deals” that are practically throwing themselves at you, but others may not be so fortunate. I like the idea of personalized shopping from the viewpoint of an e-commerce enthusiast, this is an easy way for you to ramp up sales. I can admire their ability to make the website feel like it is made for each individual person, there are many sites who are gravitating towards this presentation in order to maximize profits and who can blame them, it works. If I decide to build an online website for my project, I would like to emulate this presentation that is exemplified by AliExpress. 
At the end of the day, simple internet browsing is enough to help a Junior Developer get excited about what can be created with a keyboard. It Is important to reference these sites when developing something from scratch, major sites are constantly monitored by the “pros.” The key take away points that I would like to include in my project are simple, but I know that they will make all the difference. The ease of access and plethora of information that are easily found on a website will keep people coming back to your site, its all about convenience. I will be able to target potential shoppers by utilizing coupons and personalizing their shopping experience. I am excited to be in the position to build something of my own with much needed guidance. Upon completion of my project, I will confidently be able to say I have built my own website and can add such an accomplishment to my resume when job hunting. This is one of the beginning steps towards starting my IT career; I couldn’t be more excited!
