# ISTA PROJECT STEP TWO
## Rawlston Morton
### July 12th, 2020

After my research of various sites, I have decided to create a sports team website for my aging grandfather. His favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox, I want to build a website with information about the team’s history and culture, current players and even minor details like the gloves they prefer to wear and their bats of choice. At this point, I have little knowledge of web development and creating databases; I can picture the idea in my head and I will not give up until I am proud of what I’ve built. I have several personal goals that I want to accomplish upon completion of my project. Firstly, I want to display a clean user interface that is visually pleasing and thorough in the information provided. Second, I want to show potential employers that I am knowledgeable enough to navigate my way through the languages we are covering in the course. And lastly, I want my website to be well written so that anyone who reads my code is easily able to identify the reasons I included certain aspects. I believe that these steps are vital to becoming successful in the IT field, mastering what I know will foster strong foundations that will stick with me throughout my career.

- Choosing to create a website about the Red Sox has made me realize the amount of information that there is on the internet regarding a Major League Baseball Team. I will try to keep the personal details of the players to a minimum since fans really focus on the statistics. My database will contain information like Player Names, Players Numbers, Player Positions, Batting Averages for Hitters and Earned Run Averages for Pitchers. I will provide these types of information so the reader can easily determine stats for their favorite players I will organize the page so that this information is a statistics schema. On another page I will include information like players’ preferred equipment and details like their respective colleges as well as their amount of time in the league. If players have played on minor league teams, I will also include those teams so readers can have some insight to their favorite players. At the forefront, I want to write an introduction to the history of the team name and their culture. I will organize the web page so that the information is easily accessible. If I find that I need more data, I will come back and edit this essay. The data I provide will ensure that my website is plentiful in information and engaging for fans. I will implement this information using SQL.

- In order to build my website, I will need to have a better understanding of C#. At this point I have very little knowledge of web development and will have to do further research to clearly layout my requirements. I will have to start with an ASP.NET core web application template Visual Studio 2019. This template will provide me with the necessary tools to build my project. Some of the perks of using ASP.NET Core is that it is cross-platform, high performance and open-source. The idea of my project is to be convenient and easy to use, making the website cross-platform will ensure that readers across OS like Windows, macOS and even Linux users will be able to enjoy. I will need to call on methods that we have previously used when building console applications such as the Main method which is the entry point for any program built in C#. I will also have to call on methods that I have no experience with yet. Another method that I will have to use is the build method, this method builds the web host that is used to hosts the ASP.NET Core web application. Another method that is part of this template is the CreateDefaultBuilder Method which creates the host with set IP configured defaults. I will come back to this and add more details as I dive deeper into the project and learn the purposes of other functions in this template.

- I have mentioned that another main objective of my website is that it is Aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. I plan to keep the website simple with a concise layout to ensure readability and function. I want to open the page and immediately be greeted with a logo for the team so fans know they are on the right page! The header will read something along the lines of a greeting to the reader and the simple logo. On the left of the webpage, you will easily be able to see the different sections of information that I have included in my database. I will have the introduction and history on one page. I will then have a page devoted to the team roster will full names and player numbers. Below that I will begin with statistics of player referring to the last full season played since baseball has not begun at this point, this is subject to change. I will have the last two pages stating fun facts about the players and their preferred equipment of choice. I will conclude the website with a small outro and a bit about myself and my reasons for building the site. The UI will be a graphical interface of course, it will be team theme colored and even the Boston font if I can find it!  

- The process of solving a problem, or in this case building a webpage begins with finding the requirements. I have given myself a good starting place to begin with the project by mentioning the details of the information that will be provided, the basis of which the program will be built upon and a general layout and function of how I want the site to work. As with anything, there is always room for improving and I will be referencing my essays as a reminder for my inspiration to build my site. The best way for me to ensure a complete and functional project is to begin early, I will begin gathering requirements and learning advanced C# functions before I begin coding. The sooner I begin programming the sooner I can find bugs in my code and optimize the site. I will not be satisfied with a poorly developed website and will need to fulfill the standards I have clearly outlined for myself at the beginning of the project. Time to get to work.
