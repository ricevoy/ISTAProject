## Sports Team Fanpage

### Introduction
For my ISTA Project, I took the advice of keeping the project realistic in expectations. I am learning as 
I go and do not have the knowledge to create something vast just yet. I spend alot of time on forums where I learn fixes for my cars, computers, and various other household items. I have noticed that the layout of these forums are fairly simple, but offer lots of knowledge and a sense of community within. Being able to share ideas with others that have a common interests is awesome. For my project, I have selected a sports team theme for the "Boston Red Sox." I want to create a web app filled with information regarding various aspects of the team with several functions.

### Planning Phase


> Set goals for project completion, this includes timelines and milestones of progress to hold myself accountable.

>Gain a further understanding of C# functions, learning on my own and practicing with code. 

> Develop my ability to create a database in SQL, and utilize my db in conjuction with C#.

### Programming Phase

My main goal is to become farmiliar with several functions to demonstrate thorough understanding. I continue to gather ideas in my head that could benefit the page, but functions that I believe are vital in my   webpage include:
> Username and Password Login

> Forum Section for Fan Discussions About the Team, Players, Trades etc. (Somewhere they can post public comments and reply to each other.)

> Ability to upload Profile Pictures

> A clean user interface that is easy to use and functional

### Data Phase
On my webpage, I will need to include a database with a plethora of information about the players, some of the items I want to include are:

>ERA (Earned Run Averages) - Pitchers

> Batting Averages, Homeruns, RBIs for regular hitters.

> Equipment used by Team -  Brands, Quantities

> If possible, a schedule for upcoming games to include locations and opposing teams with dates.

### Plan of Action

> I need to begin by further outlining which information I want to include to give the page substance.

> I need to learn how to develop a webpage. 

> Need to create a thorough database

> Research and Practice, Trial and Error.

> One step at a time, staying on track to ensure completion.
